# Cacetude

Cacetude is a (hopefully) evolving interpreter starting from
a simple calculator just like any other interpreter out there.
How it's gonna evolve? We don't know yet.
It's an experimental project made by students whose university only teaches CS students the basics of grammar parsing
(e.g. how to write a calculator) in a non-compulsory course.
So this project is where we try to add more features to "a calculator" while learning more techniques by ourselves.

Its name, *Cacetude* ('ka-K-two-d), comes after *calc* and *Ã©tude*. The meaning is straightforward combining the explanation above.
